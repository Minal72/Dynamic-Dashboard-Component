# Dynamic-Dashboard-Component

# Overview
This Lightning Web Component (LWC) provides a dynamic dashboard to display objects and their records. The component leverages custom metadata (Dashboard_Settings__mdt) to store information about the objects and their related fields to be shown on the dashboard. The backend functionality is handled by the Apex class (DashboardComponentController), which retrieves the metadata records and communicates with the LWC to display the information.

# Features
Dynamic Grid Layout: The grid boxes on the UI adjust dynamically to fit three at a time on each row, providing a responsive and visually appealing dashboard.

Configurable Filters: Users can apply six different filters to refine and focus on specific data sets, enhancing the flexibility of the dashboard.The total count of records is also displayed.

Sortable Fields: Each field of the displayed object supports data sorting, similar to the functionality available on the standard records page in Salesforce.

Dynamic Icons: The icon for the object is pulled from the tab icon that is set for that particular object.

# Usage

Ensure that the necessary custom metadata records (Dashboard_Settings__mdt) are configured with the desired object and field information.
